# Welcome to Streaming Syslog to AWS Security Hub sample project!

## Overview

Most operating systems, firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are capable of emitting events via [Syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog). The purpose of this project is to provide a sample [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) project to create all the necessary resources for you to receive streaming Syslog events, parse and transform these events to [AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-findings-format.html), and lastly ingest these events as findings in [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/).

This project includes a sample Syslog event from a [Dragos SiteStore](https://www.dragos.com/) system for testing purposes, and a custom AWS Lambda function for parsing and transforming Dragos events. [Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/) is a member of the [AWS Partner Network](https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/0010h00001jBdt3AAC/Dragos), and provides Industrial Strength Cybersecurity for industrial infrastructure. 

This sample is provided for demonstration purposes only, to serve as a starting point to help you customize for your source systems. A basic understanding of Syslog and how the source system emitting Syslog events maps its fields to Syslog Common Event Format (CEF) is necessary for customization of this project.

*This project has a forthcoming [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/) which will provide greater detail regarding this solution.*

## Solution Overview

### Architecture

## Getting Started

### Pre-Requisites

In order to get started, you will need an AWS account, preferably free from any production workloads. Also, either an IAM role to deploy with from Cloud9 or an IAM user with admin permissions as the stacks we will be deploying require sufficient privileges.
Once we have that in place, itâ€™s time to get ready to deploy.

### Cloud9
[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. Cloud9 comes pre-configured with many of the dependencies we require for this blog post, such as git, npm, and AWS CDK.

Create a Cloud9 environment from the AWS console. Provide the required Name, and leave the remaining default values. Once your Cloud9 environment has been created, you should have access to a terminal window.

### Build and Deploy

From a terminal window, you will need to clone the GitHub repo, install packages, build, and deploy the CloudFormation templates. Issue the following commands in a terminal window in Cloud9. By default, the AWS CDK will prompt you to deploy changes. If you want to skip confirmations, add the following command line option to the AWS CDK commands below.
 
 <code> --require-approval never</code>

#### Clone GitHub repo
<pre><code>
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/streaming-syslog-to-aws-security-hub-sample
cd streaming-syslog-to-aws-security-hub-sample
</code></pre>

#### Bootstrap AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK v2)
<pre><code>
cdk bootstrap
</code></pre>

#### Install CDK Project required packages
<pre><code>
npm install
</code></pre>

#### Install Lambda function required packages
<pre><code>
